### Introduction
Chess AI is a classic domain for testing and improving artificial intelligence. In this project, I developed custom evaluation heuristics for a prebuilt Chess AI agent. These heuristics improved decision-making and performance against 700-rated opponents on chess.com.

### Objective
To enhance a Chess AI by:

* Designing custom evaluation heuristics.
* Modifying the minimax algorithm to improve move selection.
* Validating improvements through matches against rated bots.

### Key Features
* Tailored evaluation heuristics to optimize move selection.
* Achieved 2 wins, 1 loss, and 7 draws against 700-rated bots.
* Improved AI strategy through rigorous testing.

### Tech Stack
* Python
* python-chess
